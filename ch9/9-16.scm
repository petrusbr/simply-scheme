;; Exercise 9.16
;; Write a procedure aplize that takes as its argument a one-argument procedure whose
;; domain is numbers or words. It should return an APLized procedure that also accepts
;; sentences:
;;
;; > (define apl-sqrt (aplize sqrt))
;;
;; > (apl-sqrt 36)
;; 6
;; > (apl-sqrt â€™(1 100 25 16))
;; (1 10 5 4)

(define apl-sqrt (aplize sqrt))
