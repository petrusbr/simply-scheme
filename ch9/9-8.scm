;; Exercise 9.8
;; Suppose we’re writing a program to play hangman. In this game one player has
;; to guess a secret word chosen by the other player, one letter at a time. You’re going
;; to write just one small part of this program: a procedure that takes as arguments the
;; secret word and the letters guessed so far, returning the word in which the guessing
;; progress is displayed by including all the guessed letters along with underscores for the
;; not-yet-guessed ones:
;;
;; > (hang ’potsticker ’etaoi)
;; _OT_TI__E_

(load "simply.scm")

;; Hint: You’ll find it helpful to use the following procedure that determines how to display
;; a single letter:

(define (hang-letter letter guesses)
  (if (member? letter guesses)
    letter
    '_))

(define (hang sw g)
  (every (lambda (l) (hang-letter l g)) sw))

(hang 'potsticker 'etaoi)
